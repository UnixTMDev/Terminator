#commands -> DEAR WOLFRAM: To convert "turn the lights on" into a specific action for Jarvis (or any smart assistant), it typically involves sending a voice or text command that aligns with how the system is programmed to recognize and execute tasks. In this case, since you want Jarvis to turn on the lights, here’s what you need to do:

1. **Command Recognition**: Ensure your smart device recognizes "Jarvis" as an activation word for starting commands.
   
2. **Specific Command**: Use a clear command such as:
   - "Turn on the lights," or
   - "Light up the room."

3. **Device Connectivity**: Confirm that Jarvis is connected to your smart home system, specifically the lighting system.

4. **Configuration Check**: Ensure any necessary configurations are set (e.g., linked accounts, correct device names).

If you need to convert units related to energy consumption or brightness levels (like watts to lumens), here's a query for WolframAlpha:

```
Convert 60 watts to lumens
```

This will help you understand how much light is produced by the bulbs used in your setup.

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "What what just blew up next to me?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I could just hellbomb, but do I really want to do that?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Because of course there's a harvester there is always a harvester."
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I should have gotten out of the way I guess."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm gonna go blow up that research base."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Just gonna go obliterate it."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "That's funny."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Probably because of this harvester in the distance."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Um. Awkward."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I think I have to hell bomb. There's there's nothing else I can do to kill this thing."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Slivers never die! I'm gutted at the game."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "You guys doing alright over there? I'm seeing a lot of stray bullets."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Steven you're like a mile away. You're over by the disrupter."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Are you serious? They're just not giving me the hell bomb."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "That's fair, but like."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "And I didn't see no L-Bob."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "It's a big sky tower. Oh."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Oh boy, I sure love having my cognitive disrupted."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Wow, that's actually a really bad stratagem I just did and there's a lightning spire in the way so I can't run from it."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, yeah I know."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Because we're just going to do this and then go."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Um..."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "What is this dude? What is this dude attacking?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm gonna go annihilate this outpost."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Very democratic to leave an outpost undestroyed."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Dude I just got a vote list jump-scare."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Oh great, there's more ships I gotta go blow up."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I mean, to be fair, if you were in a war and your enemy sent one soldier to get out of there and the rest of them to go turn something off You'd probably be pretty confused too There's no outpost here."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Um... You know I would..."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Alex, I know exactly what will take some of the heat off."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "That means I start running to lead them towards the bomb."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "And then I go get Alex's samples."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Less democratic than leaving an outpost around is not grabbing your friends' samples when they get blown up by you."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Um..."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Don't worry about it."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm ready."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "There's a harvester over here."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I don't know..."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Why did we detonate?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I hadn't armed it yet because no one had gotten in the ship."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I don't think so."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I hadn't sent anything in yet."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, but it said that it said killed by explosion."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "No, I don't I don't think you can prematurely set off the hell bomb like."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I mean, wouldn't one of us have said hell bomb armed?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Alright, goodnight Steven."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Hyoga likes the ones with the civilians, I think."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I think colonists and civilians are both synonyms for schmuck."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Awesome I just wish I had one."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Guess we just hook."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I mean they have a steam deck preset."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "This well probably because you're running at 4k."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Low graphics presets don't look cool though."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I don't believe you. That doesn't make sense in my brain."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "How are you screaming you're dead You're not alive how in the hell are you screaming about your brain."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Over there."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm the friendly fire guy, I guess."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end

#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "How in the hell are these vote lists so powerful?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Now I'm gonna I'm gonna do it as soon as I get within 30 feet of you."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "What the hell?"

#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < ""
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Sorry."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I thought it would land in the street."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Hugo, I don't know. I don't know if you've ever found this out, but Warnings one second before a bomb is about to go off aren't particularly helpful."
#debug -> speech start

#userWords -> < "No, no."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "They got my IP address."
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Okay um."
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "My stratagems tend to rack everything in like a mile radius."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "So I think what I'm gonna do is head north and go blow up some outposts."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I sure hate when I try to blow up all my enemies but instead just draw aggro from everything in a two mile radius."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "A diver can dream."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "It's telling me reinforce available, and it says one, but it's still on cooldown ah hell."
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Just bring over the top BS and annihilate them."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Dude the automatons are gonna do whatever the robot equivalent of pissing themselves is When they see when they see us drop down."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Wait, are there no outposts on the map?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I could probably just drop like one laser and one 500kg And this entire objective would be knocked out in seconds Okay, well maybe not if I miss."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "One ton of explosive dropped on your tiny little teeny wimp base."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "And sure, why not? I'll hit him with an electric orbital strike, might as well."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end

#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "God, they give you 37 minutes for this?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "That took us literally three minutes to do."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, it's because of the stupid rocks. It's because of how massive they are."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm gonna go look around those bases we blew up for all the samples because I mean Really considering how weak these guys are we just sort of have to sit around for a minute and a half."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Oh."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "So."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I think that's the first time I've ever aborted an extraction. And it's cause... I mean, what are they gonna do, kill us?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I think we might as well just aim for full mission completion all samples cuz like."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, like a wimp."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Out of secondary ammo."
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "No."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, I think that mine is the most dangerous thing we've seen all mission."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I could set off one portable hellbomb and their entire forces would be gone."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "10 regular bots."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Troop I just trooper."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Thought I heard a rare sample, but I forgot there aren't any."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "All right, we're gonna have to find all of the rare sample or all of the points of interest on the map If we want full mission completion."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Mean there's no way there were 12 samples across three."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm gonna go over that way see what's there. Oh wow you found all the stuff No, you didn't that's last games logs."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Okay, you can tell your forces are weak when I can."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Into a 3DS and tab back in and still not be dead I think they might just want to stop trying."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "You didn't watch out enough."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "How come we can enter the most treacherous mission of our life and get 10 super credits and then we enter the easiest mission ever."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Oh god."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Radius just in time."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I would never."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Wow one single common sample."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Wait what?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'll give it a go."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "And that right there looks like an interesting point."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, well there's."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "A whole lot of nothing."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Hey maybe this is how they expect us to..."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I found two."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "We know the extractions available mission control. We're just stalling."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "There's something here."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "It spawns the it spawns the like."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "The rare sample flowers look after you take the rare samples out of them."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "There's just no samples on those."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, I mean these guys are a bit annoying also I forgot to reload my secondary Wow idiot moment."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Nice let me know if you stumble across a two-person one."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Gotta find that sample."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Ah, okay, on my way."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "At the point of interest mark and it's like you wanna you want to make your own ping all right."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'll just leave I'll just give these guys like a laser to keep them company."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Hey yo."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I spy with my little eye, the pet."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "The last sample's gotta be in here."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "What do you mean there's no samples?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "That's the stems and grenades are appreciated, but this is just a glorified resupply."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Something we missed at one of the sites."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Wow, this something I found is a whole lot of nothing. Flamethrowers, stims, and grenades."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yes, Mission Control, we know about the extraction."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm using a stem just for the extra stamina."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "There's automatons in the distance."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Are there some we forgot at like the extraction site?"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm going to go back into this corner."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Yeah, I don't I don't think I've ever cared this much about samples."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Else to care about in this mission."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Oh, he found it!"
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Don't worry, I've got this 500 kg that hopefully the barrage is gonna hit like you."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Good point."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Mean the century is really all we're gonna need honestly."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I think we sort of just wait for the sentry to start firing."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Firing non-lethal payload. That's lame."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Right on top of them."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Decimate and I didn't even get I didn't even pass three kills Wow."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "I'm gonna go hellbomb that patrol over there cause I mean..."
#debug -> speech start

#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah."
#debug -> speech start
#debug -> speech end
#userWords -> < "These stupid loser idiots are about to get decimated."
